	<h1>The "Me" Decade</h1>
	<h2>Setting precedence for change and modernity, the youth counterculture movements of the 1960s allowed for fashion trends to flourish in the 1970s. But unlike the 1960s, many Americans in the 1970s took a step back from political movements, choosing instead to focus on themselves. Many have referred to this shift as a "return to normalcy", giving the 1970s its nickname as the "Me" Decade. Having been introduced in the previous decade, unisex clothing became the norm by the early 70s. With more women entering the workforce than every before, pantsuits and daywear with a masculine edge were popularized among youth. Women also wore skirts in a variety of lengths, often opting for right-fitting mini skirts for everyday wear. Tight tops and loose-fitting bottoms defined fashion for both men and women during the later half of the decade. Becoming a wardrobe staple in the 1970s, blue jeans were worn by men, women and children across the country, coming in a variety of different styles. The popularity of bellbottoms continued and today, the style has become representative of the decide. Women often opted for ankle-length maxi skirts and dresses with long slits on the sides that reached the thigh. Bold patters were popular among men and women alike, along with sports jackets, chunky sweaters and pleated pants. </h2>
