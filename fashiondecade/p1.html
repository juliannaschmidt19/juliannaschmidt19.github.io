		<h1>The Roaring 20s</h1>
	<h2>The end of World War I brought a new sense of freedom and independance to women in the United Sttes. It was during this decade that the "flapper" emerged, a new type of young American woman whose clothing screamed modernity. Woman began to wear looser-fitting garnments while hemlines rose to an unprecedented knee-length level, abandoning the more restricting and uncomfortable fashions of the preceding decades. Women of the 20s often "bobbed", or cut, their hair short to fit under the iconic cloche, a snug-fit hat made of felt that was worn tilted in order to cover the forehead and ears. American men of the 20s began to dress less formal than ever before; They opted for cuffed trousers, flannel jackets and two-toned shoes for casual wear. In addition, both men and young boys began wearing short knee pants topped with lightweight sweaters and casual button-down shirts.</h2>
