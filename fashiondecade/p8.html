	<h1>The "Mash-up" Decade</h1>
	<h2>Following the 1990s, fashion in the 2000s moved away from the minimalist approach, incorporating the fusion of trends from several different styles. By the early 2000s, designers began incorporating more color and pattern into their clothing, using inspiration from vintage clothing of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Women’s fashion took a more feminine turn as women began wearing denim miniskirts and jackets, halter tops, belly shirts, low-rise jeans, and capri pants. During the mid 2000s, the tunic dress gained popularity among young women and teenagers, often paired with a thin belt at the waist. By 2007, ballet flats had become a staple in women’s fashion, along with sweater dresses and long button-down shirts. Men’s fashion during this decade resembled that of the 1980s, incorporating athletic attire into everyday wear. Men wore sneakers, baseball caps, and sweatshirts, pairing them with bootcut jeans. The 2000s saw a revival of 1960s style as more and more men began sporting black leather jackets, motorcycle boots, and ornate Ed Hardy T-shirts as well as accessories. Working men during the 2000s often opted for slim fitting pants topped with two-buttoned blazer jackets, a button-down shirt, and a thin tie. During the latter half of the 2000s, men began sporting tighter fitting clothing than ever before. </h2>
