	<h1>The Age of Counterculture</h1>
	<h2> In the US, the 1960s was defined by the rise of counterculture movements that revolutionized social norms across the country. Youth culture during the 60s rejected the emphasis on conformity that the preceding decade ingrained in society. Replacing distinct separations between the styles of clothing worn by men and women, the 1960s introduced a new phenomena: unisex clothing. Rejecting the popularity of the Mod look, which was defined by bright colors and bold geometric shapes, "Greasers" emerged across the country, challenging the colorful fashions established by Mods. Greasers, whose name derived as a result of their greased-back hairstyle, were a working class subgroup of youth that originated in the 1950s but gained popularity in the following decade. Greasers are known for popularizing the leather jacket as casual, which was previously worn by military pilots. In addition, they often wore tight fitting T-shirts and distressed jeans. The Hippie revolution was kicked off following the Summer of Love in 1967, a socio-political phenomenon when nearly 100,000 people gathered in San Francisco, inspiring social change and the acceptance of different lifestyles. Rebelling against consumerism, most hippies wore handmade clothing and accessories. Long maxi skirts and bell-bottomed jeans gained popularity along with floral patterns, bright tie-dyes, and paisley patterns. Women rejected the girdles and padded brassieres that were encouraged in the 1950s, replacing them with unconventional practices such as avoiding make-up and sporting long, unkempt hair. Black Americans of the ’60s also embraced counterculture. The fashion of the period reflected Afrocentrism, a focus on the African heritage of Black Americans. The dashiki, for example, was inspired by an African tunic, and caught on with Black youth in New York’s Harlem neighborhood, before spreading across the country.</h2>
