	<h1>The Age of Creativity</h1>
	<h2>Fashion in the early 1980s was similar to that of the 1970s. But by 1984, pop stars such as Madonna and Cyndi Lauper brought a new sense of style to the decade, one that focused on pushing boundaries with creative patterns, funky color combinations, and unique styles. Women began sporting skin-tight cotton leggings, pairing them with chunky sweaters and oversized, off-the-shoulder tops. In addition, young women also were loose-fitting parachute paints topped with figure hugging crop tops that stopped just above the belly button. Layered clothing also gained popularity. For example, mini-skirts made of either denim or spandex were often paired with leggings or legwarmers. Accessories were a huge staple during this period, particuarly for teenagers and young adults. Women often wore brightly-colored glasses, several chunky bangles and giant hoop earrings for casual wear. hair was often permed to achieve high volume and makeup featured bold eyeshadow, heavy foundation and bright lipstick. For working professional women, the 1980s brought about a new phenomenon: power dressing. Finding its origins in the 70s, power dressing gained prominence in the early 1980s and refers to a fashion style used by working women to establish authority in their professional environments. By the 80s, the idea of women in the workplace had become the norm; however, women still felt the urge to establish equality in the professional world, using fashion as their weapon of choice. Power dressing called for pairing tailored blazers complete with shoulder pads and fitted knee-length skirt. Shying away from the tightly fitted clothing of the 1970s, men in the 80s opted for loose and comfortable fabrics. Activewear was a popular choice among young men, combining sweatpants and sweatshirts with sneakers. By the late 1980s, Nike had skyrocketed to worldwide success thanks to the popularity of athletic wear among men.</h2>
