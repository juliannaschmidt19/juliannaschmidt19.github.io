	<h1>The Great Depression & World War II</h1>
	<h2>The Great Depression, which lasted from 1929 to 1939, decimated the American economy and diverted attention from fashion; mere survival became more important. Nevertheless, the struggle produced an impressive movement: the Harlem Renaissance. People of color revolutionized art, literature, and fashion. The most enduring fashion trend from this period was the Zoot Suit. Popularized by Black, Mexican, Italian and Filipino-American men, this high-waisted, wide-legged, tight-cuffed suit represented a sense of “coolness” synonymous with the period. With the period of WWII, total war in the USA resulted in shortcomings in many areas of life, including fashion. Fabric was used for parachutes, rope and netting so certain clothing items disappeared from store shelves, including stockings. So, the logical thing to do would be to stop wearing stockings until the end of the war, right? Of course not! Americans treated fashion during the war as they did with life in general: they tried to maintain a sense of normalcy in difficult times. Amazingly, women adapted by painting on their hosiery! At first, they used foundation, with black eyeliner pencils to draw the “seam.” Later, special products - such as “liquid stockings” and “leg makeup” - came out. Fashion, like frontline troops, marched on.</h2>
