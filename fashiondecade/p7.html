	<h1>The Decade of Anti-Fashion</h1>
	<h2>When compared to the flashy style of the 80s, fashion in the 90s took a much more minimalist approach. Adults of the early 1990s wore relaxed fit jeans with plain T-shirts and knit sweaters while teenage and pre-teen girls often opted for brightly-colored neon clothing: hot pinks, greens, blues, oranges and yellows. By 1992, these fluorescent colors were replaced by softer shades: coral, turquoise, lilac and more. With the rise of popstar MC Hammer came the beginning of the parachute pants, relaxed-fit pants made of cotton complete with tapered legs and a drawstring waist. Comfort became the emphasis for Americans during the decade, rejecting the uncomfortable clothing trends of the previous decade. BY 1992, grunge music reached unprecedented popularity amound youth, bringing with it a new fashion trend that would define the decade. Brightly colored clothing took a back seat to plaid flannel shirts, stonewashed jeans, and dark colors like maroon, gray, forest green, and brown. In the U.S., grunge fashion popularized Doc Martens, a British footwear brand whose black leather boots became a staple among the countryâ€™s youth. By 1995, the wide-leg jeans of the 1970s were revived along with the advent of chunky black boots and the baby doll t-shirt, popular among young women and teenage girls. Punk and alternative styles became a part of mainstream fashion in 1996, bringing with it short, spiky hair, black clothing, and skater shoes. For young women, the late 90s fashion was defined by the spaghetti strap tank top and the skort (half skirt, half shorts). Capri pants, a tapered pant ending at mid-calf, and low-rise jeans were also popular. Crop tops from the 80s continued to be worn by most young women along with tapered, high-waisted pants.</h2>
