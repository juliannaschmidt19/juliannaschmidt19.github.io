	<h1>Post War Era</h1>
	<h2>
		After WWII, fashion rebounded to the forefront of American culture in the 1950s. Once WWII came to an end, rationing became of a thing of the past, as the availability and accessibility of several different types of fabrics became the norm. It was during this decade that department stores gained popularity across the country. Women of the 1950s were expected to look and dress a certain way and many, for the most part, conformed to this newly established standard of beauty. As their husbands returned from war, the American women were expected to focus on their role as homemakers. Conformity among women was highly encouraged, eliminating the need for dramatically different styles. During this decade, hemlines dropped significantly, reaching mid-calf or even ankle length while the popularity of the hourglass silhouette rose. Dresses with flowing, bright colored skirts became the standard for subarban housewives. For working women, the much more form-fitting knee-length pencil skirt was often worn, requiring a tight firdle in order to exphasize the hourglass figure. For men, 1950s fashion was not very different from that of previous decades. Men often wore suits, sweaters, casual button-dowms and slacks, all made of similar fabrics. </h2>
