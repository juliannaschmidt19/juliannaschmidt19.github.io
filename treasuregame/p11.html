			<center>Your transport vehicle's headlights start to flicker, illuminating just enough for you and your excavation team to see what is surrounding you. You exit the vehicle and enter an unmarked area that is not shown on your map. There you see, the true treasure of Mara, a gold encarved statue. Suddenly, out of nowhere... Indiana Jones appears from a rope, landing directly between you and the treasure. He explains that the treasure is very sacred, however one must not take unless there is something to replace its weight, or you all will be in more danger. What do you do?</center>
